        Finally got around to using the config settings for table and
        key names (for apps that don't put users/roles/user_roles in
        public schema, primarily).

0.080   2014-06-20
        Added support for Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt for hashing
        and matching of passphrases for ::User objects.

0.070   2014-04-28
        Permitted user lookups on user_id instead of simply username.

0.060   2013-05-24
        First properly working version. Forgot to advertise to Catalyst
        that the plugin supports sessions and roles. Oops.

0.010   2013-05-13
        First version. Core functionality complete, useable as a basic
        authentication store in Catalyst.
